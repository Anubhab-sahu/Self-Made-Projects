# Self-Made-Projects
A list of projects made by me. Several other projects have been initiated and still under pipeline. 

Some of the most interesting and successful projects were made in an attempt to have "**fun**" such as - A* Search Algorithm, Minesweeper, Tic-Tac-Toe etc.

Many of these projects are aimed to "**play**" with unconventional data structures (like- Cartesian Tree, Sparse Set) and some of them are "**serious**" algorithms designed just to get a slight performance edge over the existing popular algorithms (like- Tarjan Offline Least Common Ancestor Algorithm whose analysis involves inverse Ackermann function).


## Awards Won

These projects won me the title of [Geek of the Month](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/geek-of-the-month/), for June 2016 given by [GeeksforGeeks.org](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)


## Projects Timeline

These projects were successfully implemented continuously from **[February 2016 - Current]** and successfully compiled on - **July 2016**.


## Credits

These projects were implemented by [Rachit Belwariar](https://in.linkedin.com/in/rachit-belwariar-a23229ab)


## Language/Technologies Used

All the projects have been implemented in **C** and **C++**
