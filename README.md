# Self-Made Projects
A list of projects made by me. Several other projects have been initiated and still under pipeline. 

Some of the most interesting and successful projects were made in an attempt to have "**fun**" such as - [A* Search Algorithm](https://github.com/gbelwariar/Self-Made-Projects/tree/master/A-Star-Search-Algorithm), [Minesweeper](https://github.com/gbelwariar/Self-Made-Projects/tree/master/Minesweeper), [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/gbelwariar/Self-Made-Projects/tree/master/Tic-Tac-Toe) etc.

Many of these projects are aimed to "**play**" with unconventional data structures (like- [Cartesian Tree](https://github.com/gbelwariar/Self-Made-Projects/tree/master/Cartesian-Tree), [Sparse Set](https://github.com/gbelwariar/Self-Made-Projects/tree/master/Sparse-Set)) and some of them are "**serious**" algorithms designed just to get a slight performance edge over the existing popular algorithms (like- [Tarjan Offline Least Common Ancestor Algorithm](https://github.com/gbelwariar/Self-Made-Projects/tree/master/Tarjan-Offline-Least-Common-Ancestor-Algorithm) whose analysis involves inverse Ackermann function).


## Awards Won

These projects won me the title of [Geek of the Month](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/geek-of-the-month/), for June 2016 given by [GeeksforGeeks](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)


## Projects Timeline

These projects were successfully implemented continuously from **[February 2016 - Current]** and published on [GeeksforGeeks](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)


## Credits

These projects were implemented, tested and compiled together by [Rachit Belwariar](https://in.linkedin.com/in/rachit-belwariar-a23229ab).<br/>
One can also find all my Test Case Generator Programs and Sample Test Cases [here](https://gbelwariar.github.io/Self-Made-Test-Case-Generators/)


## Phases of the Projects

**1. Requirements** - Any C/C++ Compiler would work.<br/>
**2. Design** - The projects are well commented and each project is accompanied with its respective Project Manual for convenience of the readers.<br/> Also read the **Description.md** file associated with all the projects to get the link to the published projects.<br/>
**3. Implementation** - All projects are implemented using C/C++. I have planned to implement them in other languages like-Python in near future.<br/>
**4. Testing/Debugging** - Several tests have been run on all the projects by generating random test cases. 
The test-case generators are included with their respective projects. <br/>
One can also find all my Test Case Generator Programs and Sample Test Cases [here](https://gbelwariar.github.io/Self-Made-Test-Case-Generators/)<br/>
**Note**- [Minesweeper](https://github.com/gbelwariar/Self-Made-Projects/tree/master/Minesweeper) and [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/gbelwariar/Self-Made-Projects/tree/master/Tic-Tac-Toe) have in-built test case generators. Hence no test case generators have been included with them.<br/>
**5. Maintenance** -The projects are maintained from time to time.
Majority of my projects have been published on [GeeksforGeeks](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) and is always at check by the heavy traffic of its readers.<br/>Any suggestions to improve the projects are welcome on gbelwariar@gmail.com.<br/>
