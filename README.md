# Self-Made-Projects
A list of projects made by me. Several other projects have been initiated and still under pipeline.

Some of these projects are aimed to "**play**" with unconventional data structures (like- **Cartesian Tree, Sparse Set**) and some of them are "**serious**" algorithms designed just to get a slight performance edge over the existing popular algorithms (like- **Tarjan Offline Least Common Ancestor Algorithm** whose analysis involves inverse Ackermann function without a pain)
