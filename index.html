<p>A list of projects made by me. Several other projects have been initiated and still under pipeline. </p>

<p>Some of the most interesting and successful projects were made in an attempt to have "<strong>fun</strong>" such as - <a href="https://github.com/gbelwariar/Self-Made-Projects/tree/master/A-Star-Search-Algorithm">A* Search Algorithm</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gbelwariar/Self-Made-Projects/tree/master/Minesweeper">Minesweeper</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gbelwariar/Self-Made-Projects/tree/master/Tic-Tac-Toe">Tic-Tac-Toe</a> etc.</p>

<p>Many of these projects are aimed to "<strong>play</strong>" with unconventional data structures (like- <a href="https://github.com/gbelwariar/Self-Made-Projects/tree/master/Cartesian-Tree">Cartesian Tree</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gbelwariar/Self-Made-Projects/tree/master/Sparse-Set">Sparse Set</a>) and some of them are "<strong>serious</strong>" algorithms designed just to get a slight performance edge over the existing popular algorithms (like- <a href="https://github.com/gbelwariar/Self-Made-Projects/tree/master/Tarjan-Offline-Least-Common-Ancestor-Algorithm">Tarjan Offline Least Common Ancestor Algorithm</a> whose analysis involves inverse Ackermann function).</p>

<h2>
<a id="awards-won" class="anchor" href="#awards-won" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Awards Won</h2>

<p>These projects won me the title of <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/geek-of-the-month/">Geek of the Month</a>, for June 2016 given by <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/">GeeksforGeeks</a></p>

<h2>
<a id="projects-timeline" class="anchor" href="#projects-timeline" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Projects Timeline</h2>

<p>These projects were successfully implemented continuously from <strong>[February 2016 - Current]</strong> and published on <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/">GeeksforGeeks</a></p>

<h2>
<a id="credits" class="anchor" href="#credits" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Credits</h2>

<p>These projects were implemented, tested and compiled together by <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/rachit-belwariar-a23229ab">Rachit Belwariar</a>.<br>
One can also find all my Test Case Generator Programs and Sample Test Cases <a href="https://gbelwariar.github.io/Self-Made-Test-Case-Generators/">here</a></p>

<h2>
<a id="phases-of-the-projects" class="anchor" href="#phases-of-the-projects" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Phases of the Projects</h2>

<p><strong>1. Requirements</strong> - Any C/C++ Compiler would work.<br>
<strong>2. Design</strong> - The projects are well commented and each project is accompanied with its respective Project Manual for convenience of the readers.<br> Also read the <strong>Description.md</strong> file associated with all the projects to get the link to the published projects.<br>
<strong>3. Implementation</strong> - All projects are implemented using C/C++. I have planned to implement them in other languages like-Python in near future.<br>
<strong>4. Testing/Debugging</strong> - Several tests have been run on all the projects by generating random test cases. 
The test-case generators are included with their respective projects. <br>
One can also find all my Test Case Generator Programs and Sample Test Cases <a href="https://gbelwariar.github.io/Self-Made-Test-Case-Generators/">here</a><br>
<strong>Note</strong>- <a href="https://github.com/gbelwariar/Self-Made-Projects/tree/master/Minesweeper">Minesweeper</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gbelwariar/Self-Made-Projects/tree/master/Tic-Tac-Toe">Tic-Tac-Toe</a> have in-built test case generators. Hence no test case generators have been included with them.<br>
<strong>5. Maintenance</strong> -The projects are maintained from time to time.
Majority of my projects have been published on <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/">GeeksforGeeks</a> and is always at check by the heavy traffic of its readers.<br>Any suggestions to improve the projects are welcome on <a href="mailto:gbelwariar@gmail.com">gbelwariar@gmail.com</a>.<br></p>
