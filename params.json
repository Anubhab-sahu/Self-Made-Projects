Several other projects have been initiated and still under pipeline. \r\n\r\nSome of the most interesting and successful projects were made in an attempt to have \"**fun**\" such as - [A* Search Algorithm](https://github.com/gbelwariar/Self-Made-Projects/tree/master/A-Star-Search-Algorithm), [Minesweeper](https://github.com/gbelwariar/Self-Made-Projects/tree/master/Minesweeper), [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/gbelwariar/Self-Made-Projects/tree/master/Tic-Tac-Toe) etc.\r\n\r\nMany of these projects are aimed to \"**play**\" with unconventional data structures (like- [Cartesian Tree](https://github.com/gbelwariar/Self-Made-Projects/tree/master/Cartesian-Tree), [Sparse Set](https://github.com/gbelwariar/Self-Made-Projects/tree/master/Sparse-Set)) and some of them are \"**serious**\" algorithms designed just to get a slight performance edge over the existing popular algorithms (like- [Tarjan Offline Least Common Ancestor Algorithm](https://github.com/gbelwariar/Self-Made-Projects/tree/master/Tarjan-Offline-Least-Common-Ancestor-Algorithm) whose analysis involves inverse Ackermann function).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Awards Won\r\n\r\nThese projects won me the title of [Geek of the Month](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/geek-of-the-month/), for June 2016 given by [GeeksforGeeks](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Projects Timeline\r\n\r\nThese projects were successfully implemented continuously from **[February 2016 - Current]** and published on [GeeksforGeeks](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nThese projects were implemented, tested and compiled together by [Rachit Belwariar](https://in.linkedin.com/in/rachit-belwariar-a23229ab).<br/>\r\nOne can also find all my Test Case Generator Programs and Sample Test Cases [here](https://gbelwariar.github.io/Self-Made-Test-Case-Generators/)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Phases of the Projects\r\n\r\n**1. Requirements** - Any C/C++ Compiler would work.<br/>\r\n**2. Design** - The projects are well commented and each project is accompanied with its respective Project Manual for convenience of the readers.<br/> Also read the **Description.md** file associated with all the projects to get the link to the published projects.<br/>\r\n**3. Implementation** - All projects are implemented using C/C++. I have planned to implement them in other languages like-Python in near future.<br/>\r\n**4. Testing/Debugging** - Several tests have been run on all the projects by generating random test cases. \r\nThe test-case generators are included with their respective projects. <br/>\r\nOne can also find all my Test Case Generator Programs and Sample Test Cases [here](https://gbelwariar.github.io/Self-Made-Test-Case-Generators/)<br/>\r\n**Note**- [Minesweeper](https://github.com/gbelwariar/Self-Made-Projects/tree/master/Minesweeper) and [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/gbelwariar/Self-Made-Projects/tree/master/Tic-Tac-Toe) have in-built test case generators. Hence no test case generators have been included with them.<br/>\r\n**5. Maintenance** -The projects are maintained from time to time.\r\nMajority of my projects have been published on [GeeksforGeeks](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) and is always at check by the heavy traffic of its readers.<br/>Any suggestions to improve the projects are welcome on gbelwariar@gmail.com.<br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n## My 10 Best Projects (in no specific order)\r\n\r\n1.
